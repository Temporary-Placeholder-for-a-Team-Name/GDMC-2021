Procedural City Generator for Minecraft as part of the GDMC competition using https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface, based on https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_client_python.

This project is now closed with the end of the GDMC Competition 2021, and the next version is in development (but private).

Currently, in the state given to the competition, the program is able to generate, in a defined area, roads according to the terrain and houses, of variable sizes and different predefined styles. The generation is far from being perfect, and the integration of the structures with the terrain could not be totally achieved. The different roads are generated one on top of the other, and are not properly linked, even though a prototype intersection is present in the code. The program does not work if only one biome is present in the area, or if it is a biome that is considered as not buildable.
