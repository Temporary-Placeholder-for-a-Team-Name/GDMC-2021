Procedural City Generator for Minecraft as part of the GDMC competition using 
https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface, based on 
https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_client_python.

Contact us at xeon0x.gaming@gmail.com or at XeonoX#8802 on the GDMC Discord.

To run the generator, please install the requirements in
requirements.txt. Load the Minecraft world with the forge mod and run
/setbuildarea with your desired coordinates. Run roads.py (and not
main.py, we are sorry about that). If the program don't launch
correctly, try again (and contact us). If the program works, you will
see in the terminal the area selected, and after some time, "Done".
