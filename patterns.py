"""
Patterns should be able to be generated in diagonals, rotating around
the Y axis, and also on different ground levels.

Patterns can be modular, meaning that inside the pattern there will be
parts that can be expanded (like windows, or space between windows, in 2
dimensions).

Patterns should support palettes blocks.

Patterns can take more than two coordinates as inputs, to be defined on
a curve for example.

Patterns are repeated in one direction only. Sure?
